We'll need to quantify performance using a different method than using a confusion matrix/ F1 score, since those only make sense for models that predict class/category (i.e. survived/ died). Since we're predicting age, a continuous variable, we'll use the sum of squared error measure. For each passenger, we'll take the squared difference between the predicted and actual age (so it'll always be positive), and then sum up the errors for all passengers. "
